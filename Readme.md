```code

intro
steps
script for steps
    brief description/purpose of step
    briefly noting alternatives (eg .NET 6 vs .NET 4.5, boilerplate vs custom)
    quick demonstration (you can briefly observe SOLID, etc.)

steps

    setup and run (hello world)
    add routes (eg. account API- open account, get account)
    add controllers (you could also demo TDD at this point)
    add models
    add views
    add data-access (eg. sqlite or mongo)
    authentication (login, logout)
    authorization (eg. restrict account to owner and account manager)
    documentation (swagger)
    logging
    unit testing (if no TDD)
    versioning (briefly noting the PR process)
    deploy (eg. Azure vs Docker/Kubernetes, CI/CD)

The idea is to keep each step very small and memorable in the demo aspect
but also give a teaser on alternative ways to approach it. In this order, we
start with something very simple and keep building on it, and run it each
time we add a step. So even if there's not enough time to cover everything,
we'd have presented a sample backend either way.Â
